This script will check the tempature of the CPU from the /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp file for 
5 minutes then ask to continue if the user wishes to continue monitoring

##plans for future editions##
1) make the output formated
2) make the output look pretty
3) allow user to set the durration of tempature monitoring

Notes!!
Output example: 46759
which means 46.759C (Celcius)

if you wish to stop it before the end time, you will have to press "Control + C" to stop the program, 
or wait till prompted to end the script
