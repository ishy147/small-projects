This script Runs the minecraft server JAR file to start the server.

notes!
if you wish to give the server more ram change the "1" in both locations to the amount of Gigabytes you wish.

if your Jar file isn't names server.jar, then you will need to rename the jar file in this script to match

you can keep nogui if you wish to keep it all terminal base, or you can remove it. (user preference)
